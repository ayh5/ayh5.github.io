      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <img src="https://myedu-images-prod01.s3.amazonaws.com/7083382-d111b3f2732171f01208bdb2586e4141-thumb" alt="Alan Ho" class="auth-image"> 
        <p>This will be my third year teaching undergraduate courses in psychology at Cleveland State University. Teaching is a rewarding and exciting job. It is always a tremendous feeling when students comes back years later and tells me how they remember my stories from class and how they learned from these stories. To be a part of someone else's success and happiness, no matter how small a part I played, is a great feeling. As your instructor, you have my commitment that I will use my education and my experience as a student to create a learning environment that will allow you to succeed.</p>

       <p>While you will find me teaching psychology classes during the day, during dinner times, you may find me at the many wonderful restaurants Cleveland has to offer. If you see me, know that you have chosen a wonderful restaurant and feel free to come over and say hi! Besides my love for food, I also enjoy having fun outside whether it is swimming, playing tennis, or going out for a run. </p>
